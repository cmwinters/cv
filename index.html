        <p>Hello, I'm Caleb. I'm an all-around product designer specializing in user experience and front-end code. I have a strong background with developer experience product design. I enjoy building design systems and working from a common set of shared components.</p>
        <p>Most recently I worked at GitHub where I helped to ship GitHub Projects, repository rules and properties, GitHub Marketplace, and more.</p>

          <h5>GitHub Projects</h5>
          <p>Designed a 0-1 project management app that replaced the legacy Projects Classic. Started from scratch. Worked with PMs and engineers to shape, design, ship, and iterate on the app. Introduced custom fields and draft issues. Helped design some custom components that were later modified and added to our design system, Primer.</p>
