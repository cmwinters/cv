Hello, I'm Caleb. I'm a an all-around Product Designer specializing in user experience, prototyping, and code. 

I've been having fun with design for a long time&mdash;ever since I started coloring outside the lines and creating my own drawings as a kid. What's great about Product Design (or UX, UI, Web Design, and whatever else we call ourselves ðŸ˜‚) is the magic of taking those beautiful, static designs and breathing them to life through code.

## Experience

### GitHub
**Senior Product Designer** | 2015&ndash;2025

At GitHub I was able to work with multidisciplinary teams to design, build, and ship several features. These included [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/issues), [Custom Properties](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-14-repository-custom-properties-ga-and-ruleset-improvements/), [Repository Rulesets](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-12-03-enterprise-repository-properties-policies-and-rulesets-public-preview/), a [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) design refactor, and a redesigned OAuth installation page that is still in use today. I was also an early contributor to the [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/).

At GitHub I learned what to do _after_ you ship something. I really enjoyed the loop of building something amazing, validating it with customer research, shipping it, and iterating on it based on feedback from users. It was like tending a garden. It was always fun to cultivate a great product experience over the long term.

### Screenbeacon
**Founding Designer** | 2014&ndash;2015

I was a co-founder and Founding Designer for the short-lived Screenbeacon, an app for monitoring visual regressions on production websites. My co-founders and I were inspired by our experience of maintaining several websites for ZURB. We dealt with so many embarrassing visual regressions due to unexpected side-effects of CSS updates. We built this app from scratch. We were [featured on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/screenbeacon#screenbeacon-2) and even got some revenue coming in. Ultimately it didn't work out, but it was still a great learning experience.

### ZURB
**Senior Designer** | 2012&ndash;2014

At ZURB I worked with clients of all sizes to kickoff a product design sprint and produce a finished set of deliverables&mdash;typically this included a polished visual design, front-end code for web pages, and a style guide. Working at ZURB felt like boot camp. I learned so much in such a short amount of time. I was responsible for planning strategy, sketching (I became an [expert with a Sharpie](https://zurb.com/blog/five-ways-to-crush-it-with-your-interface)), wireframing, visual design, front-end code, and QA (for some contracts I still had to test for IE6 ðŸ¤¢).

However, I think the highlight of working at ZURB was the opportunity to help maintain [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites.html). Foundation is an open source design system (back then we called them "frameworks") for websites, and it was one of the first to be responsive by default. I ended up making [a lot of contributions](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/commits?author=cmwinters). This is what got me interested in open source code, and it eventually led me to GitHub.

### The Digital Corps at Ball State University
**Designer** | 2008&ndash;2012

I started at [The Digital Corps](https://digitalcorps.bsu.edu/) as a student during my sophomore year at Ball State. The Digital Corps is student centered on-campus creative agency where I worked alongside other students and faculty. Initially I started as a graphic designer. As my skills improved, I got my start in web design there. This where I first learned HTML and CSS.

After I graduated, I joined the faculty at the Digital Corps where I primarily worked on a web app for classroom tests and quizzes. This really leveled up my CSS skills and it was the first time I has used version control.
